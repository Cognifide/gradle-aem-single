## Description

This project could be used to start developing **application** based on AEM.

To start developing **project** based on AEM it is recommended to use [Gradle AEM Multi](https://github.com/Cognifide/gradle-aem-multi) instead.

Documentation for AEM plugin is available in project [Gradle AEM Plugin](https://github.com/Cognifide/gradle-aem-plugin).

## Quickstart

1. Fork project using command:

    ```bash
    git clone git@github.com:Cognifide/gradle-aem-single.git && cd gradle-aem-single && gradlew fork
    ```

    and specify properties:

    ![Fork Props Dialog](docs/fork-props-dialog.png)
    
    and wait until project is forked then enter configured target directory.

2. Setup user specific project configuration using command:

    ```bash
    gradlew props
    ```
    
    and specify properties:

    ![Fork Props Dialog](docs/setup-props-dialog.png)

3. Setup local AEM instances and dependencies then build application using command:

    ```bash
    gradlew -i aemSetup
    ```
    
    and wait till complete AEM environment will be ready to use.
  
4. Develop continuously application using command:

    ```bash
    gradlew -i
    ```

## Environment

Tested on:

* Java 1.8
* Gradle 4.9
* Adobe AEM 6.4

## Building

1. Install Gradle
    * Use bundled wrapper (always use command `gradlew` instead of `gradle`). It will be downloaded automatically (recommended).
    * Use standalone from [here](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/installation.html).
2. Run `gradlew idea` or `gradlew eclipse` to generate configuration for your favourite IDE.
3. Build application and deploy using command: `gradlew` <=> `:aemSatisfy :aemDeploy :aemAwait`

## Tips & tricks

* According to [recommendations](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/gradle_daemon.html), Gradle daemon should be: 
    * enabled on development environments,
    * disabled on continuous integration environments.
* If build caches to much, you could try with `--rerun-tasks` option. See this [link](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/gradle_command_line.html) for more details.
* To see more descriptive details about errors, you could use `-i`, `--stacktrace`, `--debug` options.
* To skip tests or any other task by name use `-x test`

## Running tests 

### IntelliJ

Certain unit tests may depend on the results of running gradle tasks. One such example is the testing of OSGi Services using [OSGi Mocks](https://sling.apache.org/documentation/development/osgi-mock.html) where in order to run a test, the SCR metadata must be available for a class. Running a test like this in IntelliJ results in errors because the IDE is not aware of the Bundle plugin.

This can be worked around by configuring IntelliJ to delegate test execution to Gradle. In order to set this up, go to _Settings > Build, Execution, Deployment > Gradle > Runner_ and set your IDE to delegate IDE build/run actions to Gradle. Alternatively, you can use a dropdown menu to use a specific runner or to decide on a test-by-test basis.

## Attaching debugger

1. Execute build with options `-Dorg.gradle.debug=true --no-daemon`, it will suspend,
2. Attach debugger on port 5005,
3. Suspension will be released and build should stop at breakpoint.

## Extending build

For defining new tasks directly in build see:

 * [Build Script Basics](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/tutorial_using_tasks.html)
 * [More about Tasks](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/more_about_tasks.html)

The easiest way to implement custom plugins and use them in project is a technique related with _buildSrc/_ directory.
For more details please read [documentation](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/organizing_build_logic.html#sec:build_sources).
